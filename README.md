Scripts I've made based on DNA-seq and RNA-seq classes from "Introduction to Bioinformatics". 

The course was presented by Paul Boutros team (Ontario Institute of Cancer Research - OICR, U. Toronto)

Classes were held at the Instituto de Química from Universidade de São Paulo (IQ-USP) in September 2014.
